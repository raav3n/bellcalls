# Bell Calls
Once complete, will allow residents from Bell, CA to automate calls to leave their car overnight (per the city of bell parking enforcement). Also allows to keep track of what car was already left overnight and how many times. This resets at the start of every month.

### Updates
First Typescript and React project </br>
Sign up and login should be solid. Routing should be good too (whether logged in or not). 
Need to work on edit/remove cars and tracking in database. Fix little bug with adding cars and add signout 

### Next steps
* UI Changes
* Implement Twillio for automated phone calls 
* Trackers for car stays per night (as well as be able to reset)
* React routing - dash, login, signup  (think this is good)
* Reset password
