# Bell Calls
Once complete, will allow residents from Bell, CA to automate calls to leave their car overnight (per the city of bell parking enforcement). Also allows to keep track of what car was already left overnight and how many times. This resets at the start of every month.

### Updates
First Typescript and React project </br>
Timestamp, tracking are good. Time to work with Twillo and get the voicemails going. Also a little buggy, need to make sure to clear the mode and car selected after one action is complete (edit, delete).

### Next steps
* UI Changes
* Make logo (top left font is temp right now)
* Implement Twillio for automated phone calls 
* Reset password
