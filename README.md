# Bell Calls
Once complete, will allow residents from Bell, CA to automate calls to leave their car overnight (per the city of bell parking enforcement). Also allows to keep track of what car was already left overnight and how many times. This resets at the start of every month.

### Updates
First Typescript and React project </br>
Sign up is complete, need to setup login, and get some user input on registration (address, cars)

### Next steps
* UI Changes
* Login
* Implement authorization for firebase access per user 
* Implement Twillio for automated phone calls 
* Trackers for car stays per night (as well as be able to reset)
