# Bell Calls
Once complete, will allow residents from Bell, CA to automate calls to leave their car overnight (per the city of bell parking enforcement). Also allows to keep track of what car was already left overnight and how many times. This resets at the start of every month.

### Updates
First Typescript and React project </br>
Can now edit and delete cars but need to implement tracking in database. Play around with UI too

### Next steps
* UI Changes
* Make logo (top left font is temp right now)
* Implement Twillio for automated phone calls 
* Trackers for car stays per night (as well as be able to reset)
* Reset password
