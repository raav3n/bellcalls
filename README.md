# Bell Calls
Once complete, will allow residents from Bell, CA to automate calls to leave their car overnight (per the city of bell parking enforcement). Also allows to keep track of what car was already left overnight and how many times. This resets at the start of every month.

### Updates
Branch off master that has node js to support the use of twillio for calls.

### Next steps
* Make post for calls only usable by website and no outside enity (may need to do some sort of authentication)
* handle data from request
* test and make sure calls are properly made
